## Summon your DAO 

1. Go the the network of your DAO's choice (i.e. Mainnet, xDAI, Polygon, Aribitrum)

> The other L2s are good low-cost (almost no-cost for xDAI) alternatives to Mainnet. From the community's experience, 
> * Polygon: Good for DeFi & NFT activities, but prone to RPC issues
> * xDAI: Less DeFi & NFT activities, but more DAO activities here. xDAI works seamlessly and is almost free to use. 
> * Arbitrum: We just launched on Arbitrum, so you may experience some bugs here & there


2. Go to https://app.daohaus.club/summon

3. Select your DAO type based on Proposal Velocity, Voting Period, Grace Period. These 3 factors should reflect the decision-making nature of your DAO. 

> * Primary Token: Which token to accept for proposal deposits and rewards, if any
> * Proposal Velocity: How many proposals are possible in 1 day. For instance, the Clubs configurationa allows for 1440 proposals / day (i.e. 1 proposal / minute), whereas the Ventures configuration allows for 1 / day.
> * Voting Period: How long proposals are open for DAO members to vote.
> * Grace Period: How long DAO members have to RageQuit before the Proposal is passed 
> * Proposal Deposit: Amount deposited by user who sponsors a proposal. This is used to protect against member spam and is returned to their internal balance (minus Proposal Reward) after the proposal is processed.
> * Proposal Reward: Amount rewarded to members who process proposals

> When the DAO is summoned, these configurations cannot be changed. However, you can always re-summon your DAO with new configurations (especially on L2 solutions)

> If you'd like to configure the above configurations, please skip to Hard Mode section below. 

4. If you'd like to summon your DAO with multiple members, click "Add Multiple Summoners". For each member, provide `member address`, followed by space and `number of shares` on a new line.
