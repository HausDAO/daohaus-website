## Commitment Track Compensation Schedule

// TODO: insert comp table

## Receiving your Commitment Track compensation

Each month, the Paladins will create an steward Disperse proposals to distribute DAI and HAUS compensation from the [Warcamp DAO `Compensation Minion`](https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0xef3d8c4fbb1860fceab16595db7e650cd5ad51c1/vaults/minion/0x27ad832032022b323efabc260e46aa326c2daad9) directly to Commitment Track contributors.

These proposals should be created on the 1st of each month, though may be delayed by a couple days depending on when weekends and holidays fall. With Warcamp DAO's 7 day proposal period, you can expect to receive your compensation between the 8th and 10th of each month.
