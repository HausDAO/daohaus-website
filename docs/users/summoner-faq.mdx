  <h4><details>
  
  <summary>Q: Is there a test / staging area for creating DAOs?</summary>
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  
A: Yes, DAOhaus is on Rinkeby and Kovan. It is also really cheap to test on xDAI.

  <summary>Q: There is no explicit setting for proposal velocity in Hard Mode. Where is it?
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
A: In Hard Mode, the voting period is equal to the proposal velocity.  So, at a default of 7200 seconds, it is 2 hours. If mutiple proposals are submitted at the same time, one proposal will enter into voting every 2 hours (first in, first out).  Therefore, with a shorter voting period you raise the upper limit for proposal velocity in your DAO.
