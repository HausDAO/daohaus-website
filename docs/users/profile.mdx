We hope that you’ll end up a member of many DAOs. So rather than bookmarking a million DAO sites, we’ve built an awesome profile page where you can see all of the DAOs you’ve joined. You can also check any open votes, etc. on this page to make sure you don’t miss anything important.

In the future this is also where you can see how many boosts and $HAUS you’ve got.

## Member Profile

Anyone who is a member, or has some funds in internal balances, will have a profile view within the DAO.

From here you can:

- View Shares/Loot and Exit Amount (pro-rata claim on banks assets based on current share value)
- View recent activity within the DAO
- View and withdraw any internal balances
- Ragequit
