- Organize the app to make it easier to debug, maintain, and integrate new functionality.
- Create a common code paradigm used by all devs on the team.
- Share the rules of this paradigm to make it easier for new devs to contribute lasting code.
- Make code more consistent and readable.
- Make it easier to debug.

### Overarching Ideals

- Less code. Perform the greatest amount of work with the least amount of expression.
- Less state. Strive to eliminate excess state wherever possible.
- DRY.
- Functional is generally preferred over Object Oriented.
- No hard rules. Devs should be free to break any rule at any time. However, if they do wish to break a rule, they should outline their reasoning in a comment.
- Any major changes or new patterns should be posted in #code-review on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/daohaus"> Discord </a>.
- Clean as you go. Devs rarely refactor code months later, despite their best intentions. So it's best to deliver clean code from the outset.
- Criticism and review should be frequent and good-spirited.
- This is an ongoing process. We need to debate and discuss these rules in order to improve them.

### Review Process

- TBD (meeting, Pull request).

### Style guide

- Our linter is currently set to adhere to the <a href="https://airbnb.io/javascript/">AirBNB JS Style guide </a>.

### New Devs

- To save yourself some time, read through the review guidelines thoroughly.
- Learn the <Link to='/docs/devs/contexts'>structure of the app </Link>.
- If you're tasked with interacting with a contract (TXs), learn the <Link to='/docs/devs/tx-polling'>TX/polling/test cycle </Link>.
- Brush up on React by scouring the docs. Familiarize yourself with some of the more advanced aspects of hooks, contexts, and lazy-loading.
- If you're not comfortable with Async, take some time to browse <Link to='/docs/devs/async-await'>some examples </Link>in the docs. Check out some tutorials.
