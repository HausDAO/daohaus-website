    <summary>
      Q: I have summoned a DAO on Polygon but my DAO is not showing up on the
      DAOhaus UI. What is happening?
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: Once the transaction has went through, your DAO should have been
    summoned. From experience, the Polygon RPCs and Subgraphs tend to be
    congested, so you will need wait for your DAO to show up as 'Unregistered
    DAO' in your hub. From there, you can add in the metadata and set up your
    DAO.
