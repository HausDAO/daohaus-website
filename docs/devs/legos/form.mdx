## How it all comes together

Form Legos compose txLegos and fieldLegos.

#### Form Example

```js 
 MEMBER: {
    title: 'Membership',
    subtitle: 'Request Shares and/or Loot',
    type: PROPOSAL_TYPES.MEMBER,
    required: ['title', 'sharesRequested'], // Use name key from proposal type object
    tx: TX.SUBMIT_PROPOSAL,
    fields: [
      FIELD.TITLE,
      FIELD.SHARES_REQUEST,
      FIELD.DESCRIPTION,
      FIELD.TRIBUTE,
      FIELD.LINK,
    ],
    additionalOptions: [
      FIELD.APPLICANT,
      FIELD.LOOT_REQUEST,
      FIELD.PAYMENT_REQUEST,
    ],
  }
```

This blueprint does a few things:

- It handles some basic data about the form.
- It takes in a ``txlego`` to handle contract execution when the form submits.
- It handles validation for what fields are required. 
- It also orchestrates the fields that appear on the form, in order. 


## Form API 

#### Form.title

(String)

Sets the title that appears at the top of the form. Also will set the title that appears in the New Proposal selection page (NewProposal.js)

#### Form.subtitle

(String)

Will be responsible for setting the subtitle in the new update. 

#### form.type

(String)

Will be incorporated into the detailsToJSON data. Creates an easy way of discorvering what type of proposal is being passed to the app later on. 

#### form.required

(Array of Strings)

Takes an array of field.name(s). 

Before the proposal submits, it will iterate over this array and search for all the keys in the ``values`` object. If any of these values are falsy, it will stop the transaction and return an error for each required field where the conditions have not been met.

**Important:** Make sure to use the value that is found in the field's ``name`` key. Otherwise the form will not submit. 

#### form.tx

(TX Lego)

Recieves a TX lego. This is the transaction that will be fired when the form submits.  

If tx is empty, the form will throw an exception on submit. 

#### form.fields

(Array of Field Legos) 

Takes in an array of Field data and the factory component renders these in order. Throws an exception if it doesn't find a field component for each field.type. 

#### form.additionalOptions

(Array of Field Legos) 

An array of field legos that can be selected on the 'Additional Options' dropdown on the form. 

#### form.minionType

(String)

For minion proposals. Adds minionType to the detailsToJSON field.
