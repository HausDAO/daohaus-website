## What is a DAO?

At its simplest, a DAO is a magic internet community that allows members to raise and coordinate funds and resources. DAO stands for “Decentralized Autonomous Organization.” Because of the “organization” part, the term ends up representing a group of people. But, that organization is decentralized, and the ultimate actions of the organization are made autonomous through the use of software, which is why it can end up sounding like a tool and not an organization.

### What is a DAO for?

Whether referring to a group of people using DAO software, or the software itself, the purpose of the DAO is to facilitate coordination. The main point is the organization, and keeping that group of humans moving toward a goal. DAO software works in service of this goal, and any group using the software is using it to reduce coordination failure. And DAO software is really good at reducing coordination failure.

DAOs are so good at doing this because they allow for collective ownership over the organization and decision-making that was previously very difficult to maintain at scale. This collective mindset can have a huge impact on everything from a club, to a corporation, and DAO software can help cement.

So that short answer is this: DAOs are for facilitating human cooperation via collective ownership.

With all that said, it makes sense to break it down like this:

### A DAO is people

At DAOhaus we are very focused on the idea of “community first” development, so naturally we’re going to start by talking about the people. DAO software works in service of communities of people, and they give those communities coordination superpowers. Superpowers so great that those communities take on the label DAO.

So, when you hear someone say “you should join a DAO” what they mean is that you should join a community, team, project, whatever… that is using DAO software to coordinate decisions.

### A DAO is software

DAO software uses Web 3 smart contracts to facilitate decentralized group decision-making. At the core of the DAO is the organization’s bank, sometimes called a treasury (or hoard or whatever on DAOhaus you can customize our noun/verbage.) This isn’t just some sort of representation of a groups bank account, this is the actual account, the DAO software allows the organization to actually hold (and move around) crypto currency.

Decisions need to be made about what to do with the money in the bank, but also about membership, and really anything the group wants to coordinate around. So, DAO software also has built in mechanisms to help with this. Members are voted in (or added when the DAO is launched) and the software allows members of a DAO (or even non-members) to submit proposals, and the other members to vote on those proposals. It’s simple software, so all of this can be done with just a few clicks. And it’s Web 3, so there is no central point of control for any of this software or the associated records of votes, etc.

So, when someone says “maybe you should use a DAO” what they mean is that your organization, or team, or project might benefit from the use of DAO software for coordination purposes.
