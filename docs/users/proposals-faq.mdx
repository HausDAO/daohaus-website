      Q: I want to sponsor a proposal, but I'm unable to do so. Why is the
      button is greyed out?
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: Check to make sure you have enough wxDAI to sponsor the proposal.
    <summary>Q: Who can submit proposals?</summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

      Q: When sponsoring a proposal, the deposit amount on Metamask shows '0'.
      Why is this happening?
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: The amount will be sent in WETH, not ETH so it will not show in the
    wallet transaction window.

      Q: I want to sponsor a proposal, but I'm unable to do so as the button is
      greyed out
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: Check to make sure you have enough wxDAI to sponsor the proposal.
  </details>
</h4>

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>Q: Are all members required to sponsor a proposal?</summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: No, only 1 member is required to sponsor a proposal.

    <summary>
      Q: What are the rewards for Sponsors vs. Processors of a proposal?
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: When a proposal is processed, the sponsor will receive his initial
    deposit minus processing reward. The member who processed the proposal will
    receive the processing reward (set by the DAO).
  </details>
</h4>

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>
      Q: Must proposals be sequentially processed? i.e. one before another
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: Yes.
  </details>
</h4>

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>
      Q: Why do proposal stages in different DAOs have different time intervals
      (e.g. 10 minutes vs 1 hour)?{' '}
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: This depends on the period duration that was set up during the summoning
    of the DAO. If an interval of 1 hour was chosen, a sponsored proposal will
    go into the queue and go for voting in the period of 1 hour.
  </details>
</h4>

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>
      Q: When a proposal has gone into voting, can I cancel the proposal?
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: No, you can only vote 'No' to ensure the proposal does not pass.
  </details>
</h4>

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>
      Q: Can I configure my DAO to immediately executed once voting passes without waiting for the voting period to end? 
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: Proposals made against the main treasury would require the voting and grace period to pass before they can be executed. Alternatively, you can have a side 'Minion Safe vault' that can be executed early if some quorum is meet (i.e. some number of total shares voted Yes).

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>
      Q: I tried submitting a transaction, but the gas fees are exorbitantly high (e.g. 4ETH). Why is this so?
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: This could be because of a contract error or if the token is not approved for use. You may want to check that you're connected to the wallet, approved the token & the smart contract contents in your transaction.

## Voting & Passing Proposals

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>
      Q: Are proposals passed according to number of members or shares voted for
      the proposal?
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: The proposal will pass as long as majority of votes go to either "Yes" or
    "No". The number of members voting for a proposal is usually secondary and
    triggered only in extreme cases.
  </details>
</h4>

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>
      Q: The majority of the DAO has voted to pass a proposal. Why do I have to
      wait?
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: After a proposal has passed from voting, the DAO has to wait for the
    voting and grace period to pass before processing the proposal. The
    durations for these are set when you summon your DAO. You can also set a
    "Quorum Threshold" so that the voting period is shortened with consensus.
  </details>
</h4>

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>
      Q: My proposal has failed. Does this mean that it was not processed?
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: After the voting period has ended, when a proposal is ready to be
    processed, you will see whether or not the proposal passed/failed. If no one
    voted on the proposal, it will automatically fail. It will also fail if the
    action outlined in the proposal cannot be executed, such as sending 500
    wxDAI from your DAO to an Externally Owned Account (EOA), when your DAO
    doesn't actually hold 500 wxDAI.

  <details>
    <summary>
      Q: Does voting on proposals cost gas, or is it just signing?
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: It costs gas, but it should only require 1 yes vote if there is soft
    consensus achieved before voting.

    <summary>
      Q: What is the rough cost of submitting, approving, processing a proposal
      on Mainnet??
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: It's around ~$100 (That said, this is context and time dependent during
    the time of this Q&A).

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>
      Q: If a proposal has passed, is there any way to reverse or change the
      vote?
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: If the proposal has been passed by majority of votes, there is no way to
    reverse the proposal. However, if the proposal is in "Voting", you can
    persuade other members to vote "No" to prevent the proposal from passing.

    <summary>
      Q: If a prospective member submits a member proposal with tribute, gets it
      approved, proposal enters the grace period, and the prospect Rage Quits
      before the grace period ends, what will happen to their tribute?
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: If their shares are more than the dilution bound setting (e.g. 1/3), the
    proposal would fail when they rage quit. When a member submits a membership
    proposal, their tribute goes into the escrow and goes into the treasury only
    when the proposal is passed and processed. If the member rage quits before
    the processing, they can only take their current fair share of the treasury.
