## What is UberHaus

[UberHaus](https://uberhaus.club/docs/welcome) is the DAO that governs the DAOhaus platform and ecosystem, including the HAUS token.

As the governing body of DAOhaus, UberHaus members are DAOs themselves. This means that DAOhaus is a platform that is truly built for, owned by and goverened by DAOs! 

To participate in UberHaus governance, DAOs will need to have the HAUS token whitelisted in their DAO.
