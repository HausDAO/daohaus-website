If you're building Boosts on DAOhaus, you will be working with the DAOhaus app. Here's how to get started!

## Set up your local environment 
This tutorial was created using Terminal on MacOS.  If you are using a different OS, you may have to change some of these commands, but the process will be the same.

**1. Clone the daohaus-app repo**

  ```javascript
  git clone https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-app.git
  cd daohaus-app
  git branch <yourdiscordhandle>
  git checkout <yourdiscordhandle>
  touch .env
  ```
>Replacing ```<yourdiscordhandle>``` with your Discord handle helps us when providing support.

**2. Configure your local environment**

Open the `.env` file you just created with ```touch``` in your root directory and add the following:
``` g
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
REACT_APP_DEV=true

REACT_APP_RPC_URI=`Your URI here` 
REACT_APP_INFURA_PROJECT_ID= `Your Infura Project ID here` 
```
>If you don't have an RPC_URI or INFURA_PROJECT_ID, you can delete those lines. You can get started without them, but you won't be able to initiate contract transactions from your local machine. 

**2. Install dependencies and launch**

  ```javascript
  yarn install  // install dependencies
  yarn start // launch the DAOhaus app
  ```

## Summon a test DAO on Rinkeby 
You will require a test DAO on the Rinkeby network before you can test and simulate transactions in your local environment.
> Before you begin, please ensure that your wallet address contains Rinkeby ETH. Or else, you can request Rinkeby ETH from [rinkebyfaucet.com](https://www.rinkebyfaucet.com)

**1. Switch to Rinkeby network and visit app.daohaus.club/summon**

**2. Click on Hard Mode**

**3. Configure your test DAO's parameters**
For more efficient testing, we recommend setting shorter time periods and lower deposit amounts. You may use the following parameters to start. 
* **How many seconds per period?** Enter `60` seconds
* **How many periods will the voting period last?** Enter `1` period
* **How many periods will the grace period last?** Enter `1` period 
* **What will be the dilution bound?** Leave the default at `3`
* **How much is the proposal deposit (needs to be in wei - 18 decimals)?** Enter `500000000000000000` 
* **How much is the processing reward?** Enter `2000000000000000000`
* **Summoners & Starting Shares**
    * Enter your wallet address followed by `1` (e.g. 0x64f372ef18b423ed61719ba0c730cf84640551a6 1)
    * For additional team members, enter their address and amount of shares on another line. Separate address and amount with a space.
