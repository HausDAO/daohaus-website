##  What is DAOhaus?

DAOhaus is a no-code platform for launching and running DAOs. It is owned and operated by the community. All DAOs on the platform utilize the glorious open-source code of [Moloch](https://www.molochdao.com/).

For more information, please refer to DAOhaus documentation: https://daohaus.club/docs/

## Why contribute to DAOhaus? 

In the realms around crypto, Web3 and metaverses, solving coordination failure and unlocking the power of human-centred coordination has always been crucial in pushing the boundaries of what we can do today. Every time a community discovers a better way to coordinate and collaborate, the definition of what's possible changes fundamentally. 

And that is the reason why DAOhaus exists. With DAOhaus, we have seen different communities solve coordination failure and band together to achieve a wide array of things, from disbursing commmunity grants, collecting NFTs and forming decentralised funds

Staying true to our community roots, DAOhaus wants to be a product which is built, maintained and loved by the community. After all, as users and community members, who else would better know how DAOhaus can empower the projects and communities of tomorrow that are still bogged down by coordination failure today? 

As such, we'd like you to join us on our journey of slaying Moloch - the God of Coordination Failure! Become a DAOhaus contributor and fight with us 🔥

> On a more practical front, there are bounties and rewards for contributors for larger tasks. However, to know you better and how your contributions can fit in to our current pipeline, introduce yourself in the contributor channels and start working on a 'good-first-issue'

## Who contributes to DAOhaus? 

Currently, DAOhaus is being built and maintained by War Camp - our distributed team of 20+ core contributors. Within the team, we have different roles and responsibilities, such as Magesmiths (Product), Rangers (Community), Paladins (Operations), Alchemists (Tokenomics). 

## How can I contribute to DAOhaus? 

### 1. Select your Circle ⭕️

Want to get started? First, identify the Circle you are interested in & have the skills to contribute. 
- If you are a **designers, engineers and product person**, you belong to the **Magesmiths**' Circle which maintains & improves the DAOhaus platform.
- If you are a **community, marketing, social media and writer**, you belong to the **Rangers**' which grows spreading the DAOspel and engages with the wider DAO community. 
- If you are a  **tokenomics expert** , you belong to the **Alchemists**' Circle which works on tokenomics & HAUS token functionality. 
- If you are a  **operations and research expert**, you belong to the **Paladin**'s Circle which coordinates all DAOhaus circles & works on new problems such as Contributor Experience

You can definitely be a part of more than 1 Circle, but we recommend starting with 1 for new Contributors. 

If you'd like to contribute but don't fit in either paths, head to [#haus-roles channel](https://discord.gg/qYertDpy) on our Discord, select Contributor and we'll get you set up. 

### 2. Say gm in Discord! 👋

Head to [#haus-roles channel](https://discord.gg/qYertDpy) on our Discord & **select Contributor**. You should be able to see the Contributor channels. 

**Say gm & tell us more about yourself** on the #open-chat channel, such as: 
- What Circle are you interested in contributing to? 
- What skills or talents do you've in the respective Circle? 

Someone from the relevant Circle will reach out if there's a right fit! 

### 3. Start your first task 🛠

For **Magesmiths**, 
- A fellow Magesmith will reach out to you 
- Meanwhile, please refer to our [Contributor's Kanaban here](https://sharing.clickup.com/b/h/83fyz-1405/5c588f59600254b) for open tasks you can work on

For **Rangers**, a fellow Ranger will reach out to you & get you set up on a simple task. We're working on our open bounty board, so stay tuned! 

### 4. Level up! 🚀

As you work on more tasks, this is a good way for both the Circle & yourself to **assess if there's a fit and what's the best way of working together**. From experience, this takes **4 to 6 weeks to know each other better**, depending on the commitment, nature of tasks, etc.  

If all is good, a fellow Ranger/Magesmith will reach out & get you on our **Retroactive Compensation Track**. In this Track, you request Compensation at every month's end for the value you provided. 

After contributing on the Retroactive Compensation Track, if you want to commit even more to DAOhaus, you can opt into the **Commitment Track**. We take contributor compensation seriously - you can read more [here](get-paid)!
