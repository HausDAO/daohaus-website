[**💎 Supporter Track**](https://discord.gg/jd2bXxzEPZ)
is reserved for HAUS token holders who want to jam on HAUS tokenomics

You begin by using the `!join` command in [*#proof-of-support*](https://discord.gg/atkerEQtf4). Once you have connected your MetaMask using the Collab.Land bot, you will gain access to one of the three levels: 

- `Level 1 - 0/1 HAUS or HAUS/xDai LP`
- `Level 2 - 100 HAUS`
- `Level 3 - 500 HAUS`
- `Citadel - 2000 HAUS`

With 2000 HAUS in the Citadel, you have a sweet view of all of the innerworkings of the DAOhaus core team, as well as our client and partnership channels.
