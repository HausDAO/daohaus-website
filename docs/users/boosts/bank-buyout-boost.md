:::info
Editors' note: This Boost is especially useful for DAOs that use Minions heavily or have illiquid assets such as NFTs, which may prevent members from RageQuitting their fair share of the DAO's assets
:::

### Description

Does your DAO use Minions? If yes, your DAO’s assets are likely to be siloed into different Minion Vaults, creating issues when calculating RageQuit amounts.

This Boost helps calculate a RageQuit members’ pro-rated share from the Bank for the DAO’s approval.
Once the proposal is passed, the funds are set aside for incoming Rage Quits, ensuring that the RageQuit process is fair and efficient.

### Installation Steps

1. Summon or select a Minion
2. Add Proposals Playlist
3. Sign the transaction & your Boost is installed!
