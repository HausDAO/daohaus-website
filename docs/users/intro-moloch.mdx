## Moloch is open-source

Moloch is the simple, open-source DAO framework we use at DAOhaus. Its simplicity is important for 3 reasons:

1. Security (less code, less bugs)
2. Usability (complex tech but easiest to understand and use)
3. Extensibility (the ability to extend its functionality to meet evolving community needs).

For a brief introduction to DAOs and Molochs specifically, you can catch up via the [Moloch V2 Primer for Humans](https://medium.com/raid-guild/moloch-evolved-v2-primer-25c9cdeab455).  The latest version of Moloch can be found [here](https://github.com/HausDAO/Molochv2.1).
