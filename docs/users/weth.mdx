### What are wrapped tokens and why do I need them?

Native tokens like ETH on Ethereum Mainnet or xDAI on the xDAI network are special as they're the only token accepted for transaction fees on the respective network. As such, they can't be used inside smart contracts and to reword or submit proposals. So DAOs and a lot of their dapps use wrapped versions of those tokens. wETH is wrapped ETH, wxDAI is wrapped xDAI, and so on. As a wrapped token, they can be used now inside the DAO and dapps for proposals.

The folks at Raid Guild have built a no fees, no frills simple wrapper at https://wrapeth.com. You can wrap and unwrap at anytime.
