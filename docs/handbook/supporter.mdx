[**ðŸ’Ž Supporter Track**](https://discord.gg/jd2bXxzEPZ)
is reserved for HAUS token holders who want to jam on HAUS tokenomics.

You begin by going to the [#collabland-join](https://discord.com/channels/709210493549674598/916232863236640788) channel on Discord and following the bot's instructions. 

It will look something like this:

Once you have connected your wallet using the Collab.Land bot, you will gain access to one of the three levels: 

- `Level 1 - 0/1 HAUS or HAUS/xDai LP`
- `Level 2 - 100 HAUS`
- `Level 3 - 500 HAUS`
- `Citadel - 2000 HAUS`

With 2000 HAUS in the Citadel, you have a sweet view of all of the innerworkings of the DAOhaus core team, as well as our client and partnership channels.  

**Historical Note**  
This process used to happen with the !join command in [#proof-of-support](https://discord.gg/atkerEQtf4), so some of the conversation about this topic is still available there for you to peruse.
