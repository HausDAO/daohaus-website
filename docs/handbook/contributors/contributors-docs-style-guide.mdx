All of the documentation is written in Markdown, a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text-editor.  

Here is a nice [CheatSheet](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/cheatsheet/#tables) for Markdown that you can use when making changes to the documentation.

We are using Github Issues to help bring contributors in, ensuring we uphold the integrity and quality of our documentation as we iterate.

**2. Grammar**

We use **US English** in our documentation

**6. Contributor Requirements** 

After you have completed your contribution, post in [`#proof-of-work`](https://discord.gg/9KfzHcU85z).  

If you do not have access to the `proof-of-work` channel, visit the [`haus-roles`](https://discord.gg/89TsbY4S9g) channel and emoji the `⚒ Contributor Role` and any other role you want to take up as a community member of the Haus.

You'll now have access to the the `Contributor Track` which will guide you through the opportunities to contribute across the DAOhaus platform. 

As you gain XP for creating value, you level up and before you know it you will be a Master DAOist!
