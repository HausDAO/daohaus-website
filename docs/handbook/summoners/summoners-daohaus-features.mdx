DAOhaus is currently available on Mainnet, xDAI, Polygon and Aribtrum. As a DAO summoner, here are the DAOhaus features that should matter to you. 

> For more detailed explanations on various DAOhaus features, you can check out our Features explainers in our [user docs here](https://daohaus.club/docs/users/membership). 

## Members, Shares and Loot 

DAOhaus helps you manage stakeholders within your DAOs (i.e. **Members**). **Members** are people or organisations that own **Shares** and **Loot** in your DAO. **Members** can own both **Shares** and/or **Loot**.

> When a **Member** owns **Shares**, they have an economic share of the funds in the DAO's **Bank**, as well as voting rights in the DAO's **Proposals**. 

> When a **Member** owns only **Loot**, they only have an economic share of the funds in the DAO's **Bank**, but not voting rights in the DAO's **Proposals**.

Non-members can join the DAO by requesting for Shares / Loot via a Membership **Proposal**. **Members** can leave the DAO through a **RageQuit** proposal, thereby withdrawing their pro-rated ownership of the **Bank**'s funds. 

For more information on Membership, please refer to the [Members Explainer here](https://daohaus.club/docs/users/membership). 

## Proposals & Voting 

Decison making is done via **Proposals**, which will need to be voted on by **Members** (based on their respective Share counts)

Common types of **Proposals** are: 
* Membership - Tributing capital and Requesting new shares to join the DAO
* Funding - Tributing or Requesting funds from the DAO to work on internal projects and improvements
* Whitelist - Request to add support for a new ERC20 token
* GuildKick - Request to forcibly remove a malicious member through a vote
* Minion - A contract that allows execution of arbitrary calls i.e swapping assets in the DAO bank

The stages for **Proposals** are: 
* Submit Proposal 
* Sponsor Proposal 
* In Queue
* Voting Period
* Grace Period 
* Ready for Processing 
* Completed

For more information on Proposals, please refer to the [Proposals explainer here](https://daohaus.club/docs/proposals).

## Bank & Token 

The **Bank** holds all the DAO funds, which include ERC-20 (excluding native tokens such as ETH, xDAI, MATIC on the respective chains) and ERC-721 NFTs.

> Native tokens must be wrapped first before being sent to the Bank. Alternatively, DAOs can set up a Minion that allows the holding of native tokens. 

For an ERC-20 token to show up in the Bank's balance, the DAO must whitelist the token via a Whitelist Proposal (Tutorial here) 

For more information on the Bank, please refer to the [Bank explainer here](https://daohaus.club/docs/users/bank).

## Minion & Boosts 
Beyond the core functions of managing membership, proposals and funds, DAOhaus has **Minions** and **Boosts** that help to add extra functionality to your DAO (you can think of them like apps)

**Boosts**, in general, give you extra functionality to your DAO (e.g. adding a Discord bot to your DAO).

If you need to interact with smart contracts (e.g. swapping tokens, managing LP positions, etc.), **Minion** help you with making arbitrary calls to smart contracts. 

For more information on Boosts, please refer to the [Boosts explainer here](https://daohaus.club/docs/boosts). 


## Next Steps 

Ready to summon your DAO? There are a few ways you can summon your DAO with DAOhaus. 

* If you are setting up your DAO from scratch, you can summon your DAO in DAOhaus. [Start here](/docs/handbook/summoners/get-started)
