[**🔨 Contributor Track**](https://discord.gg/ERubbAVaFr) is for those who want to have a direct impact on DAOhaus.  

We welcome all skilled persons, technical/non-technical, who are aligned in our [mission](https://github.com/HausDAO/manifesto). 

You can begin your journey as a contributor by taking up [good first issues](https://github.com/HausDAO/haus-tasks/issues) and after completing an issue, posting in [#proof-of-work](https://discord.gg/9KfzHcU85z) under the contributor track. Once you reach Level 3, think about what Circle you could contribute the most value to, based on your skillsets, experiences and interests. More information can be found in the Bonus section below. 

Once you have arrived at Level 4, you will be eligible to pledge for membership in [WarCamp](https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0xef3d8c4fbb1860fceab16595db7e650cd5ad51c1), the core contributor DAO that helps coordinate the circles.
