## How to withdraw from your internal balance.

Funds will be sent to your internal balance in these cases:

- The DAO has a sponsorship deposit, and you have sponsored any proposals
- The DAO has a processing reward, and you've processed any proposals
- Requested Funding, and the proposal has been processed
- Submitted a proposal with tribute and then cancelled the proposal
- You have ragequit any of your shares and/or loot
- You have been guildKicked, or rageKicked

To withdraw, simply navigate to your profile within the DAO, and click 'Withdraw' by the asset, or 'Withdraw all' to withdraw all tokens. This will withdraw the tokens directly to your wallet.
