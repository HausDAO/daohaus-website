##  What is DAOhaus?

DAOhaus is a no-code platform for launching and running DAOs. It is owned and operated by the community. All DAOs on the platform utilize the glorious open-source code of [Moloch](https://www.molochdao.com/).

For more information, please refer to DAOhaus documentation: https://daohaus.club/docs/

## Why contribute to DAOhaus? 

Solving coordination failure and unlocking the power of human-centred coordination has always been crucial in pushing the boundaries of what we can do today. Every time a community discovers a better way to coordinate and collaborate, the definition of what's possible changes fundamentally. 

And that is the reason why DAOhaus exists. With DAOhaus, we have seen a variety of communities solve coordination failure and band together to solve for practical problems, from disbursing payments and commmunity grants to collecting NFTs and forming decentralised funds.

Staying true to our community roots, DAOhaus wants to be a product which is built, maintained and loved by the community. After all, as users and community members, who else would know better how DAOhaus can empower the projects and communities of tomorrow that are still bogged down by coordination failure today? 

As such, we'd like you to join us on our journey of slaying Moloch - the God of Coordination Failure! Become a DAOhaus contributor and fight with us üî•

> On a more practical front, there are bounties and rewards for contributors for larger tasks. However, to know you better and how your contributions can fit in to our current pipeline, introduce yourself in the contributor channels and start working on a 'good-first-issue'

## Who contributes to DAOhaus? 

Currently, DAOhaus is being built and maintained by Warcamp - our distributed team of 20+ core contributors. Within the team, we have different roles and responsibilities, such as Magesmiths (Product), Rangers (Community), Paladins (Operations), Alchemists (Tokenomics). 

## How can I contribute to DAOhaus? 

### 1. Select your Circle ‚≠ïÔ∏è

Want to get started? First, identify the Circle you are interested in & have the skills to contribute. 
- If you are a **designer, engineer or product person**, you belong to the **Magesmiths**' Circle which maintains & improves the DAOhaus platform.
- If you are skilled in **community, marketing, social media or writing**, you belong to the **Rangers**' which is focused on spreading the DAOspel and engaging with the wider DAO community. 
- If you are a  **tokenomics expert**, you belong to the **Alchemists**' Circle which works on tokenomics & HAUS token functionality. 
- If you are a  **operations and research expert**, you belong to the **Paladin**'s Circle which coordinates all DAOhaus circles & works on new problems such as Contributor Experience

You can definitely be a part of more than 1 Circle, but we recommend starting with 1 for new Contributors. 

If you'd like to contribute but don't fit in either paths, head to [#haus-roles channel](https://discord.gg/qYertDpy) on our Discord, select Contributor and we'll get you set up. 

### 2. Say gm in Discord! üëã

Head to [#haus-roles channel](https://discord.gg/qYertDpy) on our Discord & select the **Contributor Role**. Now you should be able to see the `üî®Contributor channel.` 

**Say gm & tell us more about yourself** in the #contributor channel, such as: 
- What Circle are you interested in contributing to? 
- What skills or talents you want to offer to the respective Circle? 

Someone from the relevant Circle will reach out if there's a right fit! 

### 3. Start your first task üõ†

For **Magesmiths**, 
- A fellow Magesmith will reach out to you 
- Meanwhile, please refer to our [Contributor's Kanaban here](https://sharing.clickup.com/b/h/83fyz-1405/5c588f59600254b) for open tasks you can work on

For **Rangers**, a fellow Ranger will reach out to you & get you set up on a simple task. We're working on our open bounty board, so stay tuned! 

### 4. Level up! üöÄ

As you make contributions, this is a good way for both the Circle & yourself to **assess if there's a fit and determine the best way of working together**. From experience, this can take up to 4-6 weeks to get to know each other better, depending on the commitment, nature of contributions, etc.

Once you are ready, you'll have the option to join the **Warcamp DAO** to become a core contributor to DAOhaus. As a core contributor, you'll have governance power over decisions made and actions taken by Warcamp &mdash; such as new compensation policies &mdash; as well as access to all Warcamp information and communication channels. See [this guide for instructions](join-warcamp) on how to join Warcamp DAO.

In the meantime, your contributions to your Circle(s) are eligible for compensation on our [**Retroactive Compensation Track**](compensation/retroactive). In the Retroactive Compensation Track, you request compensation at every month's end in accordance with the value you created.

If and once you join Warcamp DAO, you'll also have the option to move into the [**Commitment Compensation Track**](compensation/commitment). Some contributors prefer the flexibility of the Retroactive Track, while others value the increased certainty and mutual commitment of the Commitment Track.

We take contributor compensation seriously &mdash; you can read more [here](compensation/overview)!
