Here's why hundreds of DAOs have chosen to use the DAOhaus platform: 

### **Treasury Management** 
At the core of a DAO is the organization’s bank, sometimes referred to as a treasury. The bank is a critical element to the DAO software stack, as it allows for members to comingle and co-manage funds in a semi-trustless manner. DAOhaus allows you to disburse and monitor fund transfers from a shared treasury in a variety of ways. Learn more about [DAOhaus Banks](/docs/users/bank)

### **Versatile Governance** 
Share-based voting lets your team create and vote on a variety of proposal types. Decisions need to be made about what to do with the money in the bank, but also about membership, and really anything the group wants to coordinate around. DAO software has built in mechanisms to help with this. Members are voted in (or added when the DAO is launched) and the software allows members of a DAO (or even non-members) to submit proposals and allows members to vote on those proposals.

### **Boosts Marketplace** 
The DAOhaus platform includes a marketplace of community developed add-ons or "boosts" that provide a wide array of custom functionality. Learn more about the [Boosts Marketplace](/docs/users/boosts/boosts)

### **Member Protections** 
DAOhaus provides member protection through Grace Periods and the "ragequit" functionality. After a proposal passes, a Grace Period follows where members can choose to pull out their share of funds before the proposal passes, ensuring that even when there is a disagreement, each individual has options to protect their investment.

### **Community Developed** 
The DAOhaus platform is owned and operated by community members just like you.  We strive to provide many ways for people to be involved in the cultivation of the DAOhaus ecosystem. Join the [DAOhaus Discord](https://discord.gg/daohaus) to get involved. 

### **Non-transferrable Shares** 
Membership shares for your DAO can't be bought, sold or traded. 

### **Simple Interface** 
DAOhaus is simple software, so all of these functions can be handled with just a few clicks. 

### **Web3 Integration** 
Smart contract assistants or "minions" allow your DAO to interact with any external smart contract. With Web3, there is no central point of control for the treasury or associated records of votes. This is all made possible with the Moloch v2.1 smart contract framework.
