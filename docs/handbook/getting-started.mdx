## Introducing tracks

> [Join the DAOHaus Discord](https://discord.gg/KZQ2fskUcH)

As a way of onboarding new contributors, tracks make it easy to start your journey of learning and contributing to DAOhaus.

Tracks in our discord are broken down by `categories` and `channels`, which serve as focused spaces for open ideation, sharing, and knowledge transference, think meetspace coordination.

Roles are the "personas" used for participating in different tracks, making for a fun and easy way to engage in DAOhaus, contribute value, and level up... you're on your way DAOing it!

Here is a quick overview of the different **Roles** available:

| Name                                                             | Personas                                                                               |
