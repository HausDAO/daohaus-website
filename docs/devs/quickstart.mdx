If you're building Boosts on DAOhaus, you will be working with the DAOhaus app. Here's how to get started!

## Set up your local environment

This tutorial was created using Terminal on MacOS. If you are using a different OS, you may have to change some of these commands, but the process will be the same.

#### **1. Clone the daohaus-app repo**

```javascript
git clone https://github.com/HausDAO/daohaus-app.git
cd daohaus-app
git branch <branchname_that_includes_yourdiscordhandle>
git checkout <branchname_that_includes_yourdiscordhandle>
touch .env
```

> Including your Discord handle in the branch name helps us when providing support.

#### **2. Configure your local environment**

Open the `.env` file you just created with `touch` in your root directory and add the following:

```g
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
REACT_APP_DEV=true

REACT_APP_RPC_URI=`Your URI here`
REACT_APP_INFURA_PROJECT_ID= `Your Infura Project ID here`
```

> If you don't have an RPC_URI or INFURA_PROJECT_ID, you can delete those lines. You can get started without them, but you won't be able to initiate contract transactions from your local machine.

#### **3. Install dependencies and launch**

```javascript
yarn install  // install dependencies
yarn start // launch the DAOhaus app
```

## Summon a test DAO on Rinkeby

You will require a test DAO on the Rinkeby network before you can test and simulate transactions in your local environment.

> Before you begin, please ensure that your wallet address contains Rinkeby ETH. Or else, you can request Rinkeby ETH from [rinkebyfaucet.com](https://www.rinkebyfaucet.com)

#### **1. Switch to Rinkeby network** and visit [app.daohaus.club/summon](https://app.daohaus.club/summon)

#### **2. Click the Hard Mode button** in the upper right of the UI

Entering "Hard Mode" allows you to manually configure your DAO.

#### **3. Configure** your test DAO's parameters

For more efficient testing, we recommend setting shorter time periods and lower deposit amounts. You may use the following parameters to start:

- **How many seconds per period?** Enter `60` seconds
- **How many periods will the voting period last?** Enter `1` period
- **How many periods will the grace period last?** Enter `1` period
- **What will be the dilution bound?** Leave the default at `3`
- **How much is the proposal deposit (needs to be in wei - 18 decimals)?** Enter `5000000000000000`
- **How much is the processing reward?** Enter `2000000000000000`
- **Summoners & Starting Shares**
  - Enter your wallet address followed by `1` (e.g. 0x64f372ef18b423ed61719ba0c730cf84640551a6 1)
  - For additional team members, enter their address and amount of shares on another line. Separate address and amount with a space.
