Boost developers add functionality to the DAOhaus app by adding modular feature sets called "Boosts."

> To get started right away, see the [Quick Start Boost Development Tutorial](/docs/devs/quickstart/) 

As a recap, Boosts create custom *proposal types* that enable Moloch DAOs to interact with external smart contracts (via [Minions](/docs/devs/treasury/)) or off-chain APIs. Developers can work with "Code Legos" such as custom field inputs, form layouts and transaction payloads to create these Boosts

If you are a developer thinking of building a Boost, you will need to assemble the following 3 categories of Code Legos
1. [**Forms, Proposals and Playlists**](/docs/devs/boosts-forms): These render the proposal forms and fields for proposal submission.  
2. [**Contracts and ABIs**](/docs/devs/boosts-contracts): This stores the contracts and ABI (Application Binary Interface) calls that power your use cases. 
3. [**Transactions**](/docs/devs/boosts-tx): This prepares the transaction schemas that are required for the smart contract calls.
