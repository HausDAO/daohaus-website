<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>Q: Is there a test / staging area for creating DAOs?</summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: Yes, DAOhaus is on Rinkeby and Kovan. It is also really cheap to test on
    xDAI.

    <summary>
      Q: I want to summon a DAO, but I'd like to customise the DAO parameters.
      How do I do this?{" "}
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: You can switch to Hard mode and you'll be able to configure the
    parameters to meet your DAO needs.
  </details>

    <summary>
      Q: What is "Dilution Bound" in Hard Mode settings when summoning a DAO?
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: Dilution bound is a mechanism to handle edge cases where many members
    RageQuit, increasing the dilution of non-ragequit members. This hasn't been
    used before, but 3 is usually good.

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>Q: What is "Processing Reward"?</summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: The processing reward is a mechanism to incentivize members to actively
    process proposals and keep the proposal funnel clear.
  </details>

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>
      Q: There is no explicit setting for proposal velocity in Hard Mode. Where
      is it?
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: In Hard Mode, the voting period is equal to the proposal velocity. So, at
    a default of 7200 seconds, it is 2 hours. If mutiple proposals are submitted
    at the same time, one proposal will enter into voting every 2 hours (first
    in, first out). Therefore, with a shorter voting period you raise the upper
    limit for proposal velocity in your DAO.
  </details>
</h4>

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>
      Q: Can I change the proposal velocity / voting period after creating the
      DAO?
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: Unfortunately, no. The alternative would be to upgrade your DAO, clone
    the members / shares and transfer the balances over to the new DAO.
  </details>
</h4>

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>Q: Can I customise the font and colours of my DAO theme?</summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: Yes, you can customise the font and colours of your DAO theme through the
    "Custom Theme" app
  </details>

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>
      Q: I'm setting up a Grants DAO. Is there a recommended number of share per
      summoner to start with?
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: An arbitrary rule of thumb is to have more than 1, so keeping it to 10
    would be a good start. It is also helpful to set a minimum / maximum for
    members, as well as loot for whales. For instance, if 1 share is estimted to
    be 0.1 ETH, each member can have minimum 10, maximum 100 shares. For whales
    who want to add more than 10 ETH (i.e. >100 shares), they would be allocated
    loot instead of shares. This makes the DAO fair and functional for members,
    and whales.

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>
      Q: If I would like to customise my DAO further (other than the the Hard
      Mode settings), how can I do it?
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: The Hard Mode settings are the base settings of the DAO contract. Any
    other customisations will have to be done through a Minion.
  </details>
</h4>

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>Q: Who can change the metadata of the DAO?</summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: Any DAO member with shares is able to customise the DAO's metadata.
  </details>
</h4>

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>Q: How much does it cost to summon a DAO?</summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: On ETH mainnet, it depends on the gas prices. On a side chain like xDAI
    or Polygon, it is almost free at around USD0.01
  </details>
</h4>

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>
      Q: What is the best way to reset shares and loot distribution in my DAO?
    </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: The easiest way is to summon a new DAO with the desired shares
    distribution.
  </details>
</h4>

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>Q: How can I airdrop tokens to my DAO members?</summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: Using a minion, you can use Disperse.app or Multisender to send tokens to
    the list of members' addresses from the bank.
  </details>
</h4>

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>Q: How do I export my DAO transactions for taxation purposes?</summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: All DAO transactions are on-chain and you can export the transactions via contract address. Alternatively, you can use Dune Analytics to extract the information. 
  </details>
</h4>

<h4>
  <details>
    <summary>Q: My DAO is new and has no proposals. I want to ragequit but cannot do so as I'm faced with an error. How do I fix this? </summary>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    A: You are not able to ragequit because there are no proposals in the DAO yet. An easy way to rage quit will be to submit a proposal (such as Signal Proposal) and you'll be able to ragequit after.
