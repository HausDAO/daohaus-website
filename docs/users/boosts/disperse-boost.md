### Description 

Does your DAO need to distribute or airdrop tokens? 

The Disperse Boost enables your DAO to distribute tokens to multiple addresses directly through your Safe Minion. This Boost is using the same smart contract rails as [disperse.app](https://www.disperse.app). To disperse tokens, you just need to enter the token address, recipient addresses, and recievable amounts. 

Once the proposal has passed, your distribution will be on its way to the addresses.
