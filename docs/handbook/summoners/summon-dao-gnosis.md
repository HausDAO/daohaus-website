5.  Select your DAO type based on Proposal Velocity, Voting Period, Grace Period. These 3 factors should reflect the decision-making nature of your DAO. 

> * Primary Token: Which token to accept for proposal deposits and rewards, if any
> * Proposal Velocity: How many proposals are possible in 1 day. For instance, the Clubs configurationa allows for 1440 proposals / day (i.e. 1 proposal / minute), whereas the Ventures configuration allows for 1 / day.
> * Voting Period: How long proposals are open for DAO members to vote.
> * Grace Period: How long DAO members have to RageQuit before the Proposal is passed 
> * Proposal Deposit: Amount deposited by user who sponsors a proposal. This is used to protect against member spam and is returned to their internal balance (minus Proposal Reward) after the proposal is processed.
> * Proposal Reward: Amount rewarded to members who process proposals

> When the DAO is summoned, these configurations cannot be changed. However, you can always re-summon your DAO with new configurations (especially on L2 solutions)
