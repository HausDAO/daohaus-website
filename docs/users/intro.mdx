## What is DAOhaus?

DAOhaus is a no-code platform for launching and running DAOs. It is owned and operated by the community. All DAOs on the platform utilize the glorious open-source code of [Moloch](/users/intro-moloch)

### Who is this documentation for?

This documentation is to help users utilize the platform. We have a great new foundation in V2, with loads of new features now rolling out. We'll do our best to keep pace with rapid development.

### Support beyond the documentation

Feel free to hit us up in our <span class='channels'>#Support</span> Channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/daohaus). Let us know of any bugs you find, requests for new features, or just ask us anything about daos.
